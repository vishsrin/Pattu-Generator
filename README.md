Generates improvisation in Indian classical music scales

Indian classical (Carnatic) music is based on scales called ragams. Songs composed in a ragam have to follow the note sequence rules set by the ragam. The same goes for improvisation. Improvisation in a set ragam may seem simple. It may seem that every note in an improvised line can be picked randomly out of the set of notes in a ragam. However, it turns out that this does not work. Carnatic improvisation requires understanding of not just the written scales of ragams, but the unwritten rules of phrases that should be used and phrases that should not be used. That was discovered with this project.
